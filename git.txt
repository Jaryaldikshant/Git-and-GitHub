Version Control System: Also known as source control

The system used for tracking and managing the software code changes is called VERSION CONTROL

Famous Version control Systems: 1. Git
                                2. Apache Sub Version
                                3. Piper (used by Google)



Now we will use Git:-

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system, designed to handle everything from small to large projects with speed and efficiency

Installation of git: https://git-scm.com/downloads

Git CLI: Git Command Line Interface

SetUp global configuration: 

To set up global user name: git config --global user.name 

To set up global user email: git config --global user.email


Version control using git:-

create a new folder of any name and in that folder create a new file

1. Initializing the Git project: git init (it Initialize the empty git repo in the current user directory and .git named hidden folder is created (which contain all the tracking of our project))

2. To see hidden folder in the current director: ls -force 

3. To enable tracking of our project or file: git add <file_name>

4. Adding the files to VCS
    - git add <file_path>
    - git add .    (to add all files)

5. Removing the files form VCS
    - git rm <file_path>


Now we have to track changes in the code over the time:-

Introduction to Commit: Whenever we change somthing in the code we commit that 


1. To commit something in after the change: git commit -m "Message you have to pass"

2. To see history of the commits: git log

3. To see which code had change to which commit: git show

4. It will show the line by line code and changes perform by which author: git blame <file_name>


5. It will show us the : git status
